            // Skill Drill

            // #1 Create and populate an array with 10 numbers. Use the appropriate
            // JavaScript function to produce a number array which squares each
            // number.

            // #2 Create and populate an array with 10 numbers. Use the technique
            // of reduction to find the max number. You may need to explore the Math
            // API to find a simple max comparison function to help with the
            // calculation.

            // #3 Create an array of person objects. Each person object should have
            // a first name and last name. Sort the array of person objects by last
            // name.

            // Bonus #4 Create an array of random length strings. Filter the array by
            // string length. Create a function, where you will pass in the length to
            // filter on as well as the array of strings itself. Return from the
            // function return the filtered list of strings.
            // If the passed in length is less than 3 , an error should be thrown.
            // When invoking function be sure to properly handle the error.
